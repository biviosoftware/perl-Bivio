DESCRIPTION:WadiRum:\n\nWadiRum was named by the band's leader\, Stewart Er
 lich\, after traveling for 6 months in the middle east. Wadi Rum is a regio
 n in Jordan where Erlich found himself miraculously healed after suffering 
 a debilitating illness during his travels in the desert. \n\nThe music is m
 uch like the region: raw\, powerful\, silent and loud in turns\, and ultima
 tely healing. \n\nWadiRum's songs build to crescendo\, with lush harmony\, 
 dark\, warm bass and cello\, and drums that move from subtle to explosive. 
 Each song is different\, but the message is the same- the revelation of the
  human heart. \n\nAs a band\, we try to make great music onstage and in the
  studio... we write our songs together\, and bring our diverse backgrounds 
 into the musical melting pot. Our strengths include using full-range dynami
 cs\, and creating songs with evocative lyrics. \n\nWe perform in and around
  Denver and Boulder regularly\, and tend to prefer good 'listening' venues.
  \n\nCurrently\, we've started working on creating songs for our third albu
 m\, and are searching for a vocalist to replace our dear friend Jill who ha
 s moved out east...\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/wadirum\n
