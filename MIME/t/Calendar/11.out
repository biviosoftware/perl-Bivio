Jill is insightful, funny, charismatic, charming, and still their are no words to describe her talent.  A nationally renown recording artist in the top echelon of singer/songwriters in the country. Poignant, topical and over-the-top brilliant. Jill's last show at Lannie's, she teamed up with Julia Sweeney from Saturday Night Live for an amazing sold out performance. This is her 4th appearance at Lannie's. We are proud to have her back!
