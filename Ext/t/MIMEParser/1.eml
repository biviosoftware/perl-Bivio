Gear of the Week


A Place for Your Stuff
By Jim Thompson
ISP World


A wise man once said, you can never be too rich, too thin or have too 
much storage. No matter how much hard drive space you have or think you 
have, it never seems to be enough. It's kind of like socks ? you have a 
drawer full, but you can't get the right combination for a match (what 
does happen to those extra socks?). Other World Computing (OWC) can find 
your missing socks, and they can put a dent in your storage problems 
with a 120-GB portable hard drive that not only connects via FireWire 
and USB, but is quite and fast as well.

Securing Your Web Server
By Jim ThompsonISP World


For the hacker, a Web server is like a Big Mac to a man on a diet - it's 
such a visible and tempting target that it's irresistible. Any security 
professional will tell you that securing a Web sever is not only 
difficult but usually results in performance degradation. But don't give 
up. PentaSafe Security Technologies, Inc. claims their new VigilEnt 
Security Agent for Web Servers 3.0 can keep your Sun Microsystems 
iPlanet, Apache and Microsoft IIS Web servers safe without a drop in 
performance.
