<h1>The Problem</h1>





<p><i>Boss:</i>

Get me a rock.

</p>

<p><i>Peon:</i>

Sure, boss.  Let's go for a ride to the quarry.

</p>


<p>
...a little while later...
</p>


<p><i>Boss:</i>

That was easy!  Thanks for pointing out this rock.  I would have
missed it if I went by myself.

</p>

<p><i>Peon:</i>

You're welcome, boss.

</p>




<p>
The alternative moral to the story is: If you can't bring the boss to
the quarry, the boss just created a huge inefficiency.
