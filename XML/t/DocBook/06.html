<h1>The Problem</h1>





<i>Boss:</i>

Get me a rock.

<br>

<i>Peon:</i>

Sure, boss.  Let us go for a ride to the quarry.

<br>


<p><i>
...a little while later...
</i></p>


<i>Boss:</i>

That was easy!  Thanks for pointing out this rock.  I would have
missed it if I went by myself.

<br>

<i>Peon:</i>

You are welcome, boss.

<br>




<p>
The <b>alternative</b> moral to the story is: If you cannot bring the boss to
the quarry, the boss just created a huge inefficiency.
